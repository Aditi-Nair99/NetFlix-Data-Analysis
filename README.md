# NetFlix-Data-Analysis
This project explores and analyzes the Netflix dataset to uncover insights about content distribution, popular genres, release trends, and more — using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

📊 Project Overview
The goal of this analysis is to understand patterns in Netflix’s content library, such as:
- Which countries produce the most content on Netflix  
- The most common genres across different regions  
- Trends in the number of movies and TV shows added over time  
- Rating distribution and duration insights  

🧠 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation  
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization  
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis and presentation  

Here’s what I did in this project:
🎥 Imported movie dataset (mymoviedb.xlsx)
📊 Cleaned and analyzed the data in Jupyter Notebook using Pandas & NumPy
🎨 Created visualizations (ratings, genres, popularity trends) using Plotly
⚙️ Developed a Streamlit web dashboard with interactive filters, KPIs, and charts
🌗 Added dark/light theme support to make it look modern and professional

This dashboard helps users easily explore movie insights such as:
⭐ Top-rated movies
🔥 Most popular movies
🍿 Genre-wise distribution
📈 Yearly rating trends

It was a great experience connecting data analysis with dashboard visualization tools, and I learned how Streamlit can be a great alternative to Power BI for Python users.
